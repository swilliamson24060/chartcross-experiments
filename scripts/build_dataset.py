"""
Chartcross data pipeline.

Reads the raw Billboard Hot 100 weekly chart-history CSV and produces two
normalized JSON files used by the game:

  data/songs.json    - one entry per unique (title, performer-credit) song
  data/artists.json  - one entry per unique individual artist, with the
                        set of years/peaks they've charted at and the set
                        of artists they've directly co-credited with

Design decisions locked in with the user (2026-07-12):
  - Tiles can be ARTIST or SONG (matches the mockup, not just the rules text).
  - A song's "year" for matching purposes is its PEAK year (the calendar
    year in which it achieved its all-time-low peak_pos), not its debut year.
  - An artist tile's year-set/peak-set is the UNION across every song they
    are credited on (any overlap with a neighboring tile counts as a match).
  - An artist tile connects to a song tile (20-pt collaboration tier)
    whenever that artist is anywhere in the song's credit list - performing
    it alone is enough, no second co-artist required.
  - Artist-artist collaboration (20-pt tier) requires a DIRECT co-credit on
    at least one shared song - it is not transitive through a common
    third collaborator.
